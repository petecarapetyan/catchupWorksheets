These were notes from a debriefing of the catchup students Friday May 27

David Lobo, Dan and Jonny, Tim, Peter, and others were attended and enthusiastically gave their input

The second item was of unusual note - a couple felt strongly that Trevor should be made aware of what we had all discovered.

These guys did not have to be explained to about what "going dark" was. They instantly related to this and made enthusiastic comments.

  - Pete should have a 1-1 instantly if you are behind
  - We should bring Trevor in at some level to what our needs are
  - Just how overwhelming this stuff is, is sometimes easy to overlook
  - David says feel way more different and being treated like an adult is like opposite from the games people play
  - If you don't like coding get out right here and right now
  - as soon as someone starts smiling and saying things are good. meet with them.
