# FAQ:

### Why the big push on catching students up?:
    "Going dark" has become a noticeable for a small minority of bootcamp students.

    When researched further, we were advised by some students that this is what happens when they get stuck. Kind of like their way of protecting themselves - just to simply disappear.

    So from here on, we're going to assume that whenever someone falls behind, that is our cue to catch them up before they go dark, or at least until we learn otherwise.

### What will my catchup plan look like?:
    So glad you asked! Because every plan will be individualized.

    Most people just need help. But everybody needs a different kind of help, and we listen to you as what kind of help that you need.

    Then we'll fashion a plan to fit your needs. The first plan(s) might not work, but we will keep working together until we find one that does.

    Typical catch up plans might include:
      - Mandatory checkin meetings and/or 1-1s
      - Enforced attendance in catch-up meetings
      - Enforced periodic status reviews
      - Additonal reporting

### What if I never catch up with the agreed upon schedule?:
    Our goal is to help you complete the Bootcamp on-time and we will do everything in our power to make this happen. But ultimately we cannot control you and your schedule. If you're not able to complete the Bootcamp within the agreed upon schedule, then we do have a special offer that we can extend to you.
    
    This offer is called the "Pay as you go" program, and it allows you to continue to access ALL of the Bootcamp services / benefits via a monthly subscription. This subscription is discounted by about 70% for current Bootcamp students, and our company does not make any profit off of this amount (in fact we take a loss on this). 
    
    This discounted "Pay as you go" offer is $200/mo and as long as you're subscribed to this offer, you will continue to be able to join all of our check-in calls, all the catch-up group calls and you'll continue to have access to Slack. This is everything you'll need to get through the Bootcamp and come out the other end as a graduate.
    
    Once you've graduated, you'll no longer need to stay subscribed to this "Pay as you go" offer, and you'll receive all the benefits of graduation, including the career services, job guarantee and more.

### What if I never complete the bootcamp?:
    While rare, this can happen if a student decides to "throw in the towel" and give up on their hopes of getting a job as a coder. 
    
    We hate to see this as an outcome because it's not good for either party. 
    
    First, Coders Campus wants to be a Bootcamp with one of the highest success rates in the entire industry, and if you do decide to quit, this will bring down that number.
    
    Second, you will still be liable to pay back most (if not all) of the tuition, as we do not offer refunds.
    
    As you can expect, neither side walks away happy in this scenario, so let us know what we can do to avoid this from being a reality (maybe consider joining our "Pay as you go" offer explained above, or reach out to Trevor on Slack to see if there are ANY other options).

### Do we have experience with bootcamp students that need special help?:
    We have probably learned as much from our catchup students as we have been able to teach them, in return.

    Several students have helped us learn what kinds of communications work best for them, and how to structure catchup meetings and 1-1 to target their needs.

    And, as a result, we're happy to relate that several have described starting out feeling totally helpless and have ended up being tremendous successes.

### What is, and is not, extended support?:

    The key feature of extended support is access to help:

      - Checkin meetings
      - Slack support
      - 1-1 meetings with instructors

    Extended support is NOT required to graduate and get a job:

      - Your assignments will still be reviewed when completed.
      - You will still get [...] for finding a job
      - You will still have slack access to your student network

### How much does extended support (aka Pay as you go offer) cost?:

    It is currently priced at $200 monthly

### What is a catch-up meeting and how does it differ from a checkin meeting?:

    - Normal checkins
    - Helping slowest student work through problems
    - Lots of job/work coding discussions, and interview prep
    - Whatever it takes to bring each student along

### What if the catch up meetings don't fit my schedule?:
    - what flexibility is available in the scheduled catchup meetings?
    - Can I do 1-1 instead?
    -
