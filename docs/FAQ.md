# FAQ:

### Why the big push on catching students up?:
    "Going dark" has become a noticeable for a small minority of bootcamp students.

    When researched further, we were advised by some students that this is what happens when they get stuck. Kind of like their way of protecting themselves - just to simply disappear.

    So from here on, we're going to assume that whenever someone falls behind, that is our cue to catch them up before they go dark, or at least until we learn otherwise.

### What will my catchup plan look like?:
    So glad you asked! Because every plan will be individualized.

    Most people just need help. But everybody needs a different kind of help, and we listen to you as what kind of help that you need.

    Then we'll fashion a plan to fit your needs. The first plan(s) might not work, but we will keep working together until we find one that does.

    Typical catch up plans might include:
      - Mandatory checkin meetings and/or 1-1s
      - Enforced attendance in catch-up meetings
      - Enforced periodic status reviews
      - Additonal reporting

### What if I never catch up with the agreed upon schedule?:
 
    - hmm something here about as long as it's within 12 months

### What if I never complete the bootcamp?:
  
    - hmmm

### Do we have experience with bootcamp students that need special help?:
    We have probably learned as much from our catchup students as we have been able to teach them, in return.

    Several students have helped us learn what kinds of communications work best for them, and how to structure catchup meetings and 1-1 to target their needs.

    And, as a result, we're happy to relate that several have described starting out feeling totally helpless and have ended up being tremendous successes.

### What is, and is not, extended support?:

    The key feature of extended support is access to help:

      - Checkin meetings
      - Slack support
      - 1-1 meetings with instructors

    Extended support is NOT required to graduate and get a job:

      - Your assignments will still be reviewed when completed.
      - You will still get [...] for finding a job
      - You will still have slack access to your student network

### How much does extended support cost?:

    It is currently priced at $200 monthly

### What is a catch-up meeting and how does it differ from a checkin meeting?:

    - Normal checkins
    - Helping slowest student work through problems
    - Lots of job/work coding discussions, and interview prep
    - Whatever it takes to bring each student along

### What if the catch up meetings don't fit my schedule?:
    - what flexibility is available in the scheduled catchup meetings?
    - Can I do 1-1 instead?
    -
